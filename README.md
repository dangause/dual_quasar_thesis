## Dual Quasar Thesis

This is my capstone project for the physics major at Middlebury College, written in Fall 2019. I used mathematical modeling software, GALFIT, to 
simulate a number of sources exhibiting dual quasar characteristics. This project was a culmination of my research for Professor Eilat Glikman
in 2019 summer. This repository includes a Chosen_Candidates directory holding screenshots of each chosen dual quasar candidate, a paper_materials
holding miscellaneous items used in writing the paper, a papers directory holding the cited sources, a spectra_info directory with files used to 
adjust GALFIT parameters to account for cosmological redshift, an HMQclean text file with over a half million known quasars, a final powerpoint presentation,
a few miscellaneous python scripts used for image processing, and a pdf of my final paper.
